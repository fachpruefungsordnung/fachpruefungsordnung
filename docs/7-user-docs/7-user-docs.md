# User Documentation

This section provides an overview of how to work with projects within the application. It explains the structure and functionality of the project interface, with a particular focus on the Table of Content (TOC), section management, and version handling.
Users will learn how to navigate through a project, add or remove content sections, and access or edit previous versions of their work. The goal of this chapter is to enable efficient and structured project work while maintaining traceability and control over changes.
