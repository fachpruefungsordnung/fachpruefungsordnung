# FPO.Dto.*

Dto stands for **data transfer object**. It is mainly used to convert **JSON** into other data types which we can work with later, or to convert these data types into **JSON** which can then be sent to the backend. The sending and receiving of data interactions are handled in the [Request](Request.md) module.
