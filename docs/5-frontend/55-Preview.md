# FPO.Components.Preview

This component is on the right side of the [splitview](51-Splitview.md) module. It receives the rendered HTML text from the [editor](52-Editor.md) and simply displays it here. With the state label **isDragging**, it then activates or deactivates the iframe of this module to make it possible for the [splitview](51-Splitview.md) module to resize this window.
