# FPO.Components.CommentOverview

This component shows all comments sent to this text section. This also include **resolved comments**, which are not visible in [editor](52-Editor.md). Instead of showing all open conversations of all comments, it only shows the **first message** of each comments. When clicking on a comment, it then opens the [comment](53-Comment.md) module in [splitview](51-Splitview.md) with the selected comment.
